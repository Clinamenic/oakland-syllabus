[My Life](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/Ax7DZdJI-O61E8qhXBbGBw) \- Lyn Hejinian \- 1980/1987/2002 \- ​​*Decades after Gertrude Stein located Everybody's Autobiography at 13th Avenue and 25th Street, another daughter of the East Bay worked her own upbringing among the eucalyptus into another gut renovation of the English sentence. Lyn Hejinian's [My Life](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/Ax7DZdJI-O61E8qhXBbGBw) spins a simple procedure—45 sections of 45 sentences for 45 years of life—into a mirror ball of reflection on how odd it would be if we always meant what we said, and how we are nonetheless built out of what we say to each other. The open structure invites our own lives to fill the gaps. Marvelously, this is an autobiography that truly aspires to be everybody's. (Pauline Kerschen)*

[Revolutionary Suicide](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/rBSsMLeAZlbQCUYb64K1Nw) \- Huey P. Newton \- 1973  
[Buffalo Nickel](https://oaklandlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S183C1287561) \- Floyd Salas \- 1992  
[The Fifth Book of Peace](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/b1VOIlIvk3PRARtjNAK4Pg) \- Maxine Hong Kingston \- 2003 \- _Her house burned down in the 1991 fire and this is kind of about that? But also lots of other stuff._

[OG Told Me](https://oaklandlibrary.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S183C2164927) \- Pendarvis Hershaw \- 2017 \- _This is a really hard book to find, but you can read it in the library._ Life growing up in Oakland and the wisdom captured from older Black men who made it into elderhood, by a young man who always listened.  
[How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600671/how-to-do-nothing-by-jenny-odell/) \- Jenny Odell \- 2019 \- _Jenny Odell’s How to Do Nothing explores how we might reclaim our attention and redirect it together, which is what I think this syllabus is all about. Her call to “resist in place” originates from the Rose Garden and epitomizes for me a view from Oakland, rooted in both intimate proximity to and critical distance from the technocapitalist core. (Glenn Poppe)_  
[The Names of All the Flowers](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/uI9pNIAHMPFmti9qxCk3Ww) \- Melissa Valentine \- 2020 \- Melissa grew up in Oakland as part of a mixed race, lower middle class family, and came into her own as a writer even while losing her older brother to dealing, prison and gun violence.

[What You Don’t Know Will Make A Whole New World](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/Q7YcqID2tmlgj8z-ILRFhQ) \- Dorothy Lazard \- 2023 \- _Stories about Oakland’s past usually focus on what was lost, or what used to be there but now isn’t (which is doubly true for memoirs, which are so often nostalgic edging around lost youth). What I love about What You Don't Know Will Make a Whole New World (retired superstar librarian Dorothy Lazard’s Oakland memoir) is how the great work of her professional life brings the past back to life: After helping so many people in the Oakland Public Library’s Oakland history room rediscover their town, communities, and ancestry, Lazard’s recalls her youth in the Town at the moment when so many of its young people were first declaring themselves to be Black (and discovering a new kind of community in the power of that declaration); it’s subtle, gentle, and deceptively simple, but I think it exemplifies a kind of archival work that is never satisfied with leaving the past in its boxes and files, but strives to bring it to life, to take a question without an answer and make of it, a whole world. (Aaron Bady)_  
[What Kind of Bird Can’t Fly](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/Q7YcqID2tmlkt8b3QFJl2Q) \- Dorsey Nunn \- 2024 \- Dorsey grew up in East Menlo Park and is the former ED of LSPC and a co-founder of All of Us Or None, which operate out of the Freedom and Movement Center on Market St. After getting paroled out of San Quentin in 1980, moved to Oakland.

Self \- 2005 \- _It’s a classic for a reason, but Robert O. Self’s American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Post-War Oakland is the first piece of history I read about Oakland that took its overall development really seriously and understood the dialectical relationship between its Black history and the area’s most conservative elements. It’s history like this that, for me, helps to ground things like the 2024 recalls in a long regional trajectory. (Annie Lloyd)_

 [”The First Map of Oakland: An Historical Speculation as Solution to an Enigma,”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154330) Jack J. Studer, California Historical Society Quarterly 48(1), Mar. 1969 \- _Early archival records of Oakland, including the city’s official act of incorporation, often make reference to “Portois map of Contra Costa.” To Oakland historians, the map is something of a legend: despite its obvious historical importance, it appears to have disappeared off of the face of the earth. In this short but brilliantly paranoid article Jack J. Studer argues that the missing map is evidence of a broader conspiracy. During the Gold Rush, the Bay Area was flooded with cheats and charlatans who recognized that it was easier to mine gold from starry-eyed argonauts than California riverbanks. Among them was Horace Carpentier, who quickly began squatting on land owned by the Peralta family (a prominent Caliofornio clan whose latifundium spanned most of the East Bay) and selling it off parcel by parcel. While Carpentier held up the Peraltas in court (where they eventually went bankrupt), he leaned on his friends in the new state legislature to incorporate a new city on the Peralta’s land by the name of Oakland, which would weaken the Peralta’s hand. According to Studer, Carpentier hired a drifting Belgian mountebank posing as a Paris-educated architect to throw together a deeply flawed map overnight in the hopes of fast-tracking incorporation. The resulting product was apparently so obviously-fraudulent, suggests Studer, that Carpentier must have destroyed all existing copies to cover his tracks. To me the article’s attempt to use a missing document to retell the city’s municipal origin story is pure Oakland: an obsessive quest to find meaning and coherence where others simply see an unfortunate lacuna._ (Xander Lenc)

**Spiritually Oakland**

[Black Marxism](https://www.ebbooksellers.com/item/EpPBM6i8V1aSqVKzPTx_pA) \- Cedric Robinson \- 1983 \- _A book that is not_ about _The Town but nonetheless is fully_ of _The Town. Robinson was born and raised here, a child of the Second Great Migration; he was radicalized here, or more exactly he was radicalized somewhere in that ionized space between the poles of West Oakland and Cal Berkeley; he had a job in the probation department here, alongside his future wife, Elizabeth, doing something like restorative justice at a time when, in her telling, the department could be a bulwark against the cops. I picked up_ Black Marxism _not long after moving to Oakland, and it was impossible not to read each through the prism of the other. The place felt like an elaboration of the book’s project, the project like an expression of the place. At the heart of either is a story about Black flight and Black revolt and the new ways of knowing that those conditions can produce. The book never mentions Oakland, but it is as good a map of The Town’s psychic terrain as you’ll find. (Tommy Craggs)_
